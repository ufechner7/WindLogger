## WindLogger

Program to measure and analog voltage, convert the value to a wind speed and send the measured values 
via the serial port.

### TODO
1. test current code by connecting a potentiometer and measure a voltage in the range 0 to 3.3 V
2. add conversion to wind speed
3. use 10 bits instead of 8 bits
4. adjust the measurement interval to 1 Hz
